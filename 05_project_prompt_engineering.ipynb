      "   - Turn off the modem and router (unplug them or use the power switch if available).\n",
      "   - Wait for about 30 seconds, and then turn on the modem first, followed by the router.\n",
      "   - Allow the devices to boot up completely (usually around 2 minutes) and then try connecting your computer to the internet again. \n",

      "2. Verify network settings: Confirm that your computer's network settings reflect the correct WiFi network or Ethernet connection you are attempting to use.
